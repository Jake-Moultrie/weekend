# Questions:

# What is the difference between a commit and a push?
A commit is done locally. You are "committing" to the changes you have made to the file on your computer. 
A push sends your commit history in your local repository to the GitHub repository.
# What is the difference between a push and a pull?
A push sends the commited changes in hopes of updated the branch. 
A git pull command is used to download or "pull" content from a repository. 
# When do you need to pull?
You should pull everytime you want the most updated code from a repository. Otherwise, you may be working on an error that is already fixed by someone else.
